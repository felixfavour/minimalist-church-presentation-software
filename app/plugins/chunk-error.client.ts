/**
 * Recovers a tab whose lazily-imported chunks no longer exist on the origin.
 *
 * Every deploy publishes a fresh set of hashed `_nuxt/*` files and drops the
 * previous set. The operator console is a single long-lived route — churches
 * leave it open for a whole service, and PostHog shows sessions running past
 * 24 hours — so a tab routinely outlives the build it was served from. The
 * moment it lazily imports anything after a deploy the request 404s, and the
 * feature the operator just clicked silently does nothing.
 *
 * Nuxt ships a handler for this (`experimental.emitRouteChunkError`, default
 * 'automatic') but it only reloads from `router.onError` — i.e. when the dead
 * chunk aborted a *route navigation*. This app barely navigates, so that path
 * effectively never fires and the tab stays broken until someone thinks to
 * refresh. nuxt.config.ts sets the option to 'manual' so Nuxt still emits
 * `app:chunkError` but installs neither built-in plugin, leaving the policy
 * here.

 * losing the console mid-service is worse.
