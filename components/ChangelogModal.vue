- You can now add your own images and videos as backgrounds for your slides.
- We've added support for your audio-only files for media slides. Just go ahead and create a media slide and see the customizations you can add to your media(audio) slide.
- You can now play, pause and restart your media files with the Media slide controls.
- One alert is not enough, we added an alert scheduler so you can store alerts and take any one live as you wish.
- This one is exciting! We added a countdown timer for your convenience. Now you can let your congregation know what how soon an event starts or finish in an exciting manner.
- Sharing is caring; now other people can use the songs you uploadâ€”but only if you want.
- We don't want you to ever make a mistake taking slides LIVE. So we added a two-step feature to the "Display Bible" action on the quick actions pane.
- Want to edit a live slide quickly, double tap the slide in the Live Output pane and make your quick adjustments ;)`
